# x-scanner

Behavioral labels on every post you scroll past on X, judged by [Jev](https://docs.typesafe.ai),
TypeSafe's System One model, with a counter in the corner showing exactly what it cost.

Each post is sent to Jev with six typed questions in one request as soon as it comes within 800 px
of the viewport. The answer comes back in about 150 ms as numbers, not prose, and lands in a chip
under the post, usually before you have scrolled to it. Most posts
come back clean. The ones that don't get an orange flag. Scroll for a minute and the panel reads
something like 80 posts, $0.0027.

## What v0.5 adds

- **Analysis presets.** Default (the original six questions), Signal, AI / Tech, and Article. Results are cached per
  preset, so switching never reuses one preset's answers for another.
- **Article analysis.** When a post links out, x-scanner offers an *Analyze article* action. Nothing is fetched or
  billed until you click it, and the result is cached by canonical URL.
- **Thread context.** On a post's own page, the Signal and AI / Tech presets can attach the quoted post, the direct
  parent, or a couple of preceding posts, so a reply can be judged with what it answers.
- **Session panel.** Click *session* in the HUD for posts analyzed, cache hits, cost, average latency, flagged counts,
  useful vs noisy dimensions, and the top-scoring posts and articles. It costs no extra Jev calls.

## Install

Chrome 120 or newer, or Firefox / Zen for a development build. Until a store listing is live, install from source; Node 22 or newer is needed to build.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/oso95/x-scanner.git
cd x-scanner
npm install
npm run build
```

1. Open `chrome://extensions`, turn on Developer mode, click **Load unpacked**, choose the `dist-chromium/` folder.
2. Click the x-scanner icon. Paste your TypeSafe API key, click **Test connection**, then **Save**.
3. Open [x.com](https://x.com) and scroll: home, profiles, search, threads, lists.

Firefox and Zen (development, unsigned):

```sh
npm run build:firefox
```

1. Open `about:debugging#/runtime/this-firefox`, click **Load Temporary Add-on**, and choose `dist-firefox/manifest.json`. See `ZEN_TEST.md` for the full smoke-test checklist.
2. Click the x-scanner icon. Paste your TypeSafe API key, click **Test connection**, then **Save**.
3. Open [x.com](https://x.com) and scroll.

Chromium uses a background service worker (`background.service_worker`). Firefox and Zen use an MV3 event-page background script (`background.scripts`) because Firefox does not run `background.service_worker` for this extension. Application code is shared; only the generated manifest differs. Builds land in `dist-chromium/` and `dist-firefox/`.

Your key lives in this browser's extension storage and nowhere else. The only network traffic is the
post text to `api.typesafe.ai`. No server, no analytics.

## What you see

**Under each post**, a chip styled like X's own metadata line:

- `✓ clean` in green when nothing crossed a threshold, followed by every value in gray.
- `⚑ engagement bait 97%` in orange when something did, followed by the rest in gray.
- `no text to analyze` or `promoted, not analyzed` in dashed gray for posts that are skipped.
- Click the chip for a card with a bar per dimension, the token count, cost and latency of that call.

**Bottom right**, a small panel: posts analyzed this session, dollars spent to four decimals, the last
call's latency, and judgments per second. The dollar figure is exact, not estimated: Jev returns
`usage.input_tokens` with every answer.

## The six dimensions

Five judge the text's behavior, one is a topic check. None judge the author. Every one is editable in
settings.

| label | type | question, in short | flags when |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `fact-dense` | Score, 4 levels | how much specific, verifiable content the text has | ≥ 2.5 of 3 |
| `engagement bait` | Noul | does it end by asking for replies, reposts, likes, follows, or bookmarks | ≥ 75% |
| `promo` | Noul | is it pushing a product, course, newsletter, community, or paid offer | ≥ 75% |
| `secondhand` | Noul | does it only relay someone else's view without adding its own argument | ≥ 75% |
| `filler` | Score, 3 levels | how much of it is filler relative to the information it carries | ≥ 1.5 of 2 |
| `jevpilled` | Noul | is the post about Jev or TypeSafe (not a person named Jev). Flags in red | ≥ 75% |

A Noul answer is Jev's probability that the answer is yes. A Score answer is a position on ordered
levels you describe. `fact-dense`, the one positive label, uses these four:

0. No specific claims; opinion, mood, or a generic statement with nothing that could be checked
1. One concrete detail such as a number, name, date, or link; the rest is general
2. Several specific, checkable details: numbers, named sources, dates, or steps
3. Dense with specifics; most sentences carry a checkable fact or a concrete instruction

Thresholds, labels and direction are display policy. Change them and nothing is re-billed. Change a
question's wording, its levels, or the model, and the result cache is dropped.

## Presets

| preset | what it judges | context on a post page |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Default | the six dimensions above; user editable | quoted post only |
| Signal | density, actionability, originality, evidence, promo, bait | quoted post + direct parent |
| AI / Tech | technical depth, benchmark support, novelty, speculation, implementation use, hype | quoted post + a couple of preceding posts |
| Article | density, evidence, sourcing, originality, depth, promo, speculation, action | used for linked pages |

The three non-Default presets are read-only in v0.5; their thresholds are first-pass defaults for this release
rather than values calibrated against a labelled set. The Default preset keeps v0.1's questions and thresholds
exactly, so an upgraded install behaves the same as before until you switch.

## Cost and speed

Measured on 2026-09-18 with `jev-1.13.0` over the 18 sample posts in `test/fixture/samples.json`.
`npm run calibrate` reproduces it for under a tenth of a cent.

| | |
| --- | --- |
| input tokens per post | 906 on average, about 720 of them the six questions themselves |
| cost per post | $0.000038 |
| cost per 1,000 posts | $0.038 |
| latency per call | 174 ms on average, first call of a session around 350 ms |
| price basis | $0.042 per million input tokens, output free ([docs.typesafe.ai/models](https://docs.typesafe.ai/models)) |

## Settings

- **Enabled**: master switch.
- **Scope**: everywhere on X (default), or the home timeline only.
- **Only when logged in as**: a handle, for people who switch accounts and want it on one.
- **Analyze replies/comments**: off by default. While it is off, posts X marks as replies are never sent to Jev, so they add no cost and show no chip. Text quoted inside a post is not a reply and is always included.
- **Analysis preset** and **thread context**: which typed questions run, and how much of a thread is attached.
- **Articles**: whether the *Analyze article* action appears, the character cap sent to Jev, the article cache size,
  and a one-time **Grant article access** control.
- **Dimensions**: add, remove, disable, rename, switch between Noul and Score, edit the question, levels
  and criteria, set the threshold, whether the flag fires above or below it, and the flag color.
- **Advanced**: model (pinned to `jev-1.13.0` so thresholds keep their meaning), price, base URL,
  concurrency, look-ahead distance, wait before analyzing, cache size.
- **Lifetime**: totals across sessions, a reset, and a cache clear.

The questions default to English on purpose. Jev's docs say English is where its accuracy is best and
CJK is handled but not equally well. The post text goes in as written, in whatever language.

## How it works

- A MutationObserver picks up each `article` X mounts in its virtualized timeline; an
  IntersectionObserver with an 800 px bottom margin fires as soon as a post is near the viewport.
  A wait before sending is available in settings for people who would rather pay only for posts
  they actually stopped on.
- The content script extracts the post id, text, quoted text and reply flag, and asks the service
  worker to analyze. Only the service worker holds the API key.
- One `POST /v1/systemone` per post carries all six questions. Retries follow the official SDKs:
  429 and 529 back off, everything else fails fast.
- At most 6 requests are in flight; the rest queue in order. A queued post that scrolls out of the
  zone before its turn is dropped, so a fast flick past fifty posts does not bill fifty calls. Set
  look-ahead to 0 and a wait of 200 ms to pay only for posts you actually stopped on.
- Results are cached by post id in extension storage. Scrolling back, reloading, or returning the next
  day re-bills nothing.
- Promoted posts and posts with no text are never sent.
- Article text is fetched only when you press *Analyze article*, is reduced to the readable body, capped at the
  configured character limit, and cached under its canonical URL.

## Development

```sh
npm run build            # Chromium development build → dist-chromium/
npm run build:chromium   # same as npm run build
npm run build:firefox    # Firefox/Zen development build → dist-firefox/
npm run package          # build and zip dist-chromium/ for the Chrome Web Store
npm run package:firefox  # zip dist-firefox/ for sideload/archive
npm run watch            # rebuild dist-chromium/ on change
npm test             # unit tests
npm run test:e2e     # loads the built extension into Chrome for Testing (SCREENSHOT=1 also writes docs/screenshot.png)
npm run calibrate    # real Jev calls over the sample posts (needs TYPESAFE_API_KEY in the env)
npm run screenshots  # 1280x800 store screenshots from the fixture into store/
npm run typecheck
```

Store listing copy, permission justifications and the privacy policy are in `store/` and `PRIVACY.md`.

The end-to-end test starts a fake Jev server, scrolls the fixture like a reader, and checks that the
right flags appear, that promoted and empty posts are never sent, that the panel's cost equals token
usage times price, that node recycling does not double-bill, that scrolling back and reloading send
nothing new, that scope and account filters pause the extension, and that the settings page round
trips. It needs a Chromium or Chrome for Testing binary (`npx playwright-core install chromium`, or
set `CHROME_PATH`). Branded Google Chrome no longer accepts `--load-extension`.

## Limits

- Jev reads literally. A post written to argue for its own classification can move an answer, which is
  why thresholds default high.
- Article extraction is a small readable-text pass, not a reader-mode engine. Pages that render entirely in client-side JavaScript, or that hide the body behind a paywall or a consent wall, yield little or no text, and the card says so rather than sending page chrome.
- Thread context is read from the DOM of the page you are on, and only on a post's own URL. A home-timeline neighbour is never treated as a parent.
- Session ranking uses a fixed weighted sum over each preset's typed answers. It is a local sort key, not a judgement about the post's value.
- Replies by the original author that form a thread are skipped while Analyze replies/comments is off, because X does not mark that distinction. Author-thread detection is intentionally deferred.
- Works on x.com as of September 2026. The selectors live in `src/content/selectors.ts`; if X changes
  its markup, that is the file to fix. The automated tests run against the fixture, not live X.
- Promoted posts are recognized by the "Ad" label in a handful of UI languages. Add yours to
  `selectors.ts` if X shows something else.
- The prompts are tuned on English. Run `npm run calibrate` on your own samples before trusting the
  defaults in another language.
